# Search-Algorithms
Practice for implementing different searching algorithms in a maze

Depth First Search:
Follows one path as deep as possible until it hits a dead end or the goal. If it runs into a dead end, return to the last decision point and try a new path.

Breadth First Search:
Follows all possible paths simultaneously. Will always find the best solution but may perform many unnecessary moves

Greedy Best First Search:
Uses the Manhattan Distance estimate to always move to the square with the lowest distance to goal.
